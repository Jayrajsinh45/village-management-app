## 🚧 What is Missing (Phase 2)

To complete Phase 2, we need to build:

1. **Add Village Screen**: Currently, you can't add villages from the app. We need a form to input village details (Name, Description, Population, Location).
2. **Profile Screen**: Currently a placeholder. Users need to see and edit their details.
3. **Edit Village**: Admin capability to update village info.

## 🎯 Recommended Next Step

**Build the "Add Village" Screen.**

Without this, the app is empty because there are no villages in the database.
Once we build this, you can:
1. Log in as Super Admin.
2. Click "Add Village".
3. Create a village.
4. See it appear in the Home Screen list.

**Shall we proceed with building the "Add Village" screen now?**
